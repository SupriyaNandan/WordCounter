ðŸš€ Excited to share my first milestone in the CodeAlpha Internship! ðŸš€

I just completed Task 1: A Java-based Word Counter Application built with Swing. The project combines functionality with a sleek, modern interface to deliver:

âœ¨ Real-time word, character, and sentence counting
âœ¨ A clean, minimalist UI with smooth error handling
âœ¨ Thoughtful design elements to enhance the user experience

This project was a great opportunity to refine my Java skills, especially in GUI development. I'm thrilled with how it turned out, and Iâ€™m looking forward to the next challenge! Check out the screenshots and demo! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“¸
